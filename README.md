# Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Multi-Channel Supervised Learning

1) If running for the first time, execute ```python create_noisy_colors.py```  to create synthetic data
2) Run ```python train.py``` to see menu options and train QCNN.
3) View results in the ```./output``` folder. Files are named based on the time the training for the model began.
